       "[\"Hi Alan, first of all thank you for this video. I’ll do my best to explain everything in this comment to clear some of the stuff up that you mention.\\n\\nThe first thing is that you disagree with the video, obviously you’re quite knowledgeable about this topic and I think you presented all the points well. I’ll definitely take the criticisms to heart. I haven’t really thought much about including the sources but it makes a lot of sense to do. I’ll go back and add those. Hopefully they will bring some clarity to my points in the video. I will say though that it was an opinion piece but I could probably have done a better job making that more clear.\\n\\nThe second thing is plagiarism. The section of my video you show where I used Vox’s words instead of my own is 100% plagiarism and I’ve cut that part out of the video. It should have never been in the video in the first place, I don't know what I was thinking and I’m truly ashamed of myself for this.\\nI’ve always looked to Vox for inspiration because to me they are the gold standard on YouTube. I’ve developed a lot of my skills by imitating what they’ve made both in editing, animations, and scriptwriting in order to eventually figure out my own style, and I went too far. \\nIn regards to the rest of the video, it wasn't copied or plagiarised from anywhere. And I truly mean that.\\nI should point out that the footage I used from Not Just Bikes was done so correctly and falls under fair use. I still wanted to compensate him though because I felt bad after he expressed concern over it on his Twitter even though it was fair use.\\n\\nThe third thing is you say that I’ve copied/plagiarised 60% of my videos. This is not true. You apparently had your Discord community find the videos they believed to be copied/plagiarised from other creators. But I’m honest when I say, I haven’t even seen most of the videos you show. Nor have I copied any of them. Sometimes I do make a video on a topic that other creators have covered before, that's inevitable,  but why would that make it a copy? If making a video on the same topic as another creator is considered “copying/plagiarising” we wouldn’t have many videos left on this platform that weren’t exactly that. I truly don’t wish to copy or plagiarise anyone, and since the instance with Vox I’ve made a point not to watch any other creator's video on a topic I’m going to cover until the video is finished and uploaded. (Sometimes it is unavoidable though as I might have watched a video on the topic in the past).\\nIt’s disheartening to see that you didn’t care to dig a little deeper and actually compare these videos yourself before making such a bold and hurtful claim. \\n\\nLastly, the reason I deleted my community post.\\nI must admit I was frustrated the day I deleted that post. I had just found out that some of the creators mentioned in it had instead of expressing their concerns to me, done shady things to hurt my channel. It had to do with sponsors and it had to do with their agency, you can figure the rest out for yourself. I can’t elaborate further on that. I should have just kept it up regardless but I hope actions speak louder than words.\\n\\nThank you,\\nOliver\",\n",

       " 'I\\'m conflicted on this video, and for that matter, your whole channel.\\n\\nIt\\'s abundantly clear that Youtube became a Reddit-style echo chamber and just about everything about American infrastructure is in the crosshairs of its adolescent rage. Grid cities are a good example: their purpose is obvious, they were fairly good for the rapid expansion of US urban areas, they are easy to navigate intuitively, and some are better than others, particularly in the eastern areas where they predate cars. This video clears up some of that. Also, the pretentiousness of channels like City Beautiful and Adam Something shows just how sure they are in their position, and that really needs to be called out. I\\'ve seen videos that just go over Google Earth satellite views of multiple cities and critiques the designs without setting foot in the cities or knowing anything about their history, and this is somehow not considered ridiculous.\\n\\nMy problem comes just from not seeing anyone really talk about what\\'s really driving these videos: an over-the-top hatred of cars. It seems likely to me that cars have become a symbol of evil in the West, which is not rational. From what I see, the automobile is in a tie for the most positively transformative technology in contemporary history (air conditioning is the other one), and no one wants to make the argument FOR them to balance out the chorus. Even obvious points: scheduling freedom, the ability to haul goods easily, the inevitability of motorized transport for emergency services if nothing else, the lower expense for roads versus other transit that makes travel to undeveloped areas more practical, the prerogative to go somewhere and be left alone while en route, all this is never given its due. Electric cars are the compromise, and I support the idea of a hybrid car-walkable-mass transit system, but I think a lot of younger people don\\'t. There\\'s no balance and a lot taken for granted. I think the deeper reason is because, in a hybrid system, the ones who end up being able to keep their cars will be the ones who have more discretionary income, and the internet\\'s hatred of the American rich and bourgeois middle class is such that they can\\'t stand the idea of such an obvious quality of life difference between them and the poor. Since this is America, this translates into racism as well. Oh, and since cars most obviously benefit people in rural and small towns in the far-flung US, the distaste for ignorant country bumpkins can go in there as a factor, too. It\\'s not a practical issue anymore, it\\'s moral, and it\\'s a fundamentalist morality. \\n\\nYour videos are above average simply for their willingness to do a little independent thinking, here and elsewhere, but could you do me a favor and at least consider the idea that cars are such a positive for many of us that they should get some of the respect for their infrastructure that the electrical grid gets? We understand there\\'s a fiscal, administrative, and environmental cost to electrical power generation, but for its huge benefits, we can offset them in a bunch of ways and it\\'s worth it. For many of us, cars are the same way. \\n\\nI should hope that people don\\'t really think \"car-free\" is the future, but I see a lot of people that do: Wendover can\\'t even make a video about electric car production without 80% of its comments saying \"JUST GET RID OF CARS, YOU IDIOTS\". It\\'s impossible to talk with these people. Try making that video. I want to see if someone who knows how to make a good AV argument can do it.',\n",
